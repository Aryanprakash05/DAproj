About the Project
This project is designed to solve a real-world data analytics problem using Python and data science tools. The repository includes notebooks and scripts for:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model building and evaluation
Handling imbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTE-Tomek
Multiclass and multilabel classification tasks
Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Scaling and encoding of features
Combining oversampling and undersampling with SMOTE-Tomek
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
Understanding data distributions and relationships
Machine Learning Models:

Implementations of algorithms like LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest
Multiclass and multilabel classification with scikit-learn wrappers
Advanced Techniques:

Classifier Chains, One-vs-One (OvO), and One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategies
Evaluation metrics for multiclass and multilabel tasks (Accuracy, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, F1-Score)
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Aryanprakash05/DAproj.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd DAproj
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository:

Predictive_Maintenance_multilabel_classification.ipynb for notebook users
Run the respective .py files if scripts are included.
Configure the dataset:

Ensure the dataset is located in the appropriate directory, as mentioned in the code.
Update the dataset path if needed.
Run the code cells or script step by step to execute the pipeline:

Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model training and evaluation
The results will be displayed in the console or as visualizations in the notebook.

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing or inconsistent data values.
Scale numerical features and encode categorical ones.
Balance the dataset using SMOTE-Tomek.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the relationships between features.
Generate plots for better insights into the data.
Model Training:

Build pipelines with preprocessing and base models (e.g., LightGBM, Random Forest).
Experiment with advanced techniques like OvR and classifier chains.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using multiclass and multilabel metrics like Accuracy, MCC, and F1-Score.
Running the Code
To run the project, follow these steps:

Jupyter Notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open Predictive_Maintenance_multilabel_classification.ipynb and run cells sequentially.
Python Script:

Run the main Python script:
bash
Copy code
python main_script.py
Ensure that the dataset is correctly linked within the script.
Results:

Results will be displayed as printed output or saved plots, depending on the implementation.
